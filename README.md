# Final project: Book donations mobile application
Intelligent Mobile Development
My final project is on developing an android mobile application which can be used by university library to collect donations from students who may have more books that they want to donate to those who may have limited learning resources. This mobile application will be developed in Android studio IDE using Java programming language for the application's back end and the SQLite database to store the book donations made by students. The main user of this mobile application is the an application manager who needs to sign in before they can access the apps functionalityies which include the followig:
<ul>
  <li>View all donations from the applications' home page.</li>
  <li>Create book donations.</li>
  <li>Update donations from the update page.</li>
  <li>Delete donations.</li>
</ul>
